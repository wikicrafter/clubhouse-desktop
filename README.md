# clubhouse-desktop

This is an unofficial desktop client for the currently trending ClubHouse.

# Any bans on the accounts is possible so use it at your own risk!

Developed Using Electron JS + Vue JS + AgoraSDK.

To download already builded app open folder named <a href="ZipFiles">ZipFIles</a> and download it.


The source code is a little bit  mess, but since it's been developed in a hurry (about 30-40hrs) to get it working and also since it was  first time using Electron, Vue, and Agora.
So if you think it's a mess, feel free to make it clean and create a pull request.
